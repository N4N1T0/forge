## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended package manager)
- Appwrite account and project setup

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd forge
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

# Appwrite Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_WORKSPACES_COLLECTION_ID=your_workspaces_collection_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_MEMBERS_COLLECTION_ID=your_members_collection_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_IMAGES_BUCKET_ID=your_images_bucket_id

# Server-side Appwrite (Admin)
NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY=your_appwrite_api_key
```

### 4. Appwrite Setup

1. Create an Appwrite project
2. Set up the database with collections:
   - **Workspaces**: `name` (string), `userId` (string), `imageUrl` (string, optional)
   - **Members**: `userId` (string), `workspaceId` (string), `role` (enum: ADMIN/MEMBER)
3. Create an images bucket for workspace avatars
4. Configure authentication methods (email/password, OAuth providers)

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### API Layer

- **Edge Runtime**: API routes run on Vercel Edge Runtime for optimal performance
- **Hono Framework**: Lightweight web framework with type-safe RPC client
- **Route Structure**:
  - `/api/login/*` - Authentication endpoints
  - `/api/workspace/*` - Workspace CRUD operations

### Authentication

- **Session-based**: Secure cookie-based sessions with Appwrite
- **Middleware**: Route protection and automatic redirects
- **Role-based Access**: Admin/Member permissions for workspace operations

### State Management

- **React Query**: Server state caching and synchronization
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on errors
- **Real-time**: Automatic refetching and cache invalidation

## 🔒 Security Features

- **CSRF Protection**: Secure cookie handling
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all API endpoints
- **File Upload Security**: Restricted file types and sizes
- **Role-based Authorization**: Workspace-level permissions
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data protection
